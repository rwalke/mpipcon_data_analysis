power consumption data analysis

__What information can we derive from the 15-minute grid data on electricity consumption?__


A first example program 

* retrieve the dataset from the edmond dataverse repository

* store a copy locally

* read the dataset

* cleaning up the date/time information

* create some example graphs with ggplot2

The following histogram shows electricity consumption at 12 noon.

The next chart shows electricity consumption at 12 noon, grouped by day of the week.

In the subfolder R and Stata you will find more examples.

Example 4 uses Stata to calculate the moving average to examine the cycles of 24 hours and 7 days.
